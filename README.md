Upon initiating the game by clicking the ‘Play Game’ text seen on the start-up screen, you will need to enter the portal. After entering the portal, you will find yourself in a cage. Enemies will enter and attack you in this cage however you cannot exit until 30 seconds has passed. 

After 30 seconds you are able to traverse the whole map and at this stage you have two choices: Stay on the gird and survive as long as possible to raise your high score or exit the map as soon as possible by finding the teleport (look for the blue beam of light to help guide you) and enter it the same way you did to initiate the game. 

Remember, your score is only saved if you manage to escape.

To access the array of audio feedback Recognizer employs, it is recommended that you play with either headphones or the sound on.
